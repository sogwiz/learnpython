# FashionNova Search
This project involves 0 (zero) coding; instead, we'll execute code and follow what it does. The code does a search on the fashionnova website using python. Rather, I will ask you to summarize what the program does.

You'll learn about API request, while loops, and json

## Instructions
1. Go to the fashionnova website and do a search. Easy, right? https://www.fashionnova.com/
1. Underneath the covers, this is the URL that is generated when doing a search on fashionnova website : https://premium-fnova-dot-acp-magento.appspot.com/?q=work&s=www.fashionnova.com&cdn_cache_key=1566483085&v=5.672.066&store_id=2939277&UUID=8fb37bd6-aef1-4d7c-be3f-88bafef01308 
What happens when you click the URL ?
1. Run the program
```
python3 lesson2_fnsearch.py
```
4. What happens when you run it? (Does it fail? If so, maybe you need a python library... how do you know which library and how do you install the library)
Read through the program and try to understand what it is doing. Play around and modify some things
Write me a 5 to 8 bullet point summary of what the program does
